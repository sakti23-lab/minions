# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Minions is an autonomous task management system with a Kanban board UI. Users create tasks via a chat interface; each task is a Hermes agent session that autonomously decides how to execute — doing the work itself, spawning child sessions, or creating Hermes cron jobs shown in Minions as Routines. After each agent turn, a lightweight completion judge evaluates whether the task is done and moves it to review automatically. The user never talks to child sessions directly; recurring work is managed from the Routines page.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Hermes agent installed with its Python venv (default location: `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`)

The server spawns a Python worker subprocess that imports Hermes `AIAgent` directly — no `hermes gateway` process or HTTP API is involved. The Python executable is resolved in this order:

1. `HERMES_PYTHON` env var (explicit path)
2. `HERMES_AGENT_DIR/venv/bin/python` (if `HERMES_AGENT_DIR` is set)
3. `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python` (default)
4. `python3` (system fallback)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # dev mode: tsx watch + Vite dev server on :6969
npm run build        # production build: server (tsc) + client (vite) + copy .sql/.py assets
npm run start        # run compiled production build
npm run prod         # build + run production in one command
```

No test suite or linter is configured.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React/Vite :6969)
  ↕ HTTP + SSE
Express API + Vite middleware (:6969)
  ↕ JSONL over stdin/stdout
Python worker (hermes_worker.py)
  ↕ direct Python import
Hermes AIAgent
```

- **Server** (`server/`): Express + SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode). All timestamps are epoch milliseconds.
- **Python worker** (`server/workers/hermes_worker.py`): JSONL bridge that imports Hermes `AIAgent` directly. Spawned as a subprocess by `HermesWorkerAdapter`, auto-restarts on crash. Manages concurrent agent runs via semaphore (default: 10).
- **Client** (`client/`): React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand + react-router. `@shared` path alias resolves to `../shared/`.
- **Shared** (`shared/types.ts`): TypeScript types used by both client and server.

### State directory

All persistent state lives under `MINIONS_HOME` (default: `~/.minions/`):
- `data/minions.db` — SQLite database
- `logs/` — log files
- `workspace/` — default working directory for Hermes task artifacts

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agent communication | Python subprocess + JSONL | Imports Hermes AIAgent directly — no HTTP gateway overhead, structured streaming events, per-task model/reasoning control |
| Task execution | Autonomous agent session | Each task IS a Hermes session. The agent decides execution strategy (self, child session, Hermes cron job/routine). Our backend doesn't manage child sessions. |
| Completion judge | Lightweight LLM call after each agent turn | After a chat stream completes, the server sends the response to a `judge.completion` worker request. A fast judge model evaluates whether the task looks done and auto-moves to `in_review`. No polling, no prompt pollution — the judge runs outside the conversation. |
| Source of truth | Hermes SessionDB for chat history; Minions SQLite for task metadata; in-memory LiveChatRun for active streams | Hermes owns all transcripts and replay. Minions has no message table. `tasks.id` is the Hermes root session ID; Minions stores task metadata, per-task settings, and `last_agent_response_at`. During active streaming, `live-chat.ts` holds an in-memory `LiveChatRun` with accumulated messages. After streaming ends and the run TTL expires, chat history is projected from Hermes SessionDB on demand. |
| Status ownership | Judge auto-moves to `in_review`; human moves everything else via drag-drop | Clean separation: judge evaluates completion, human controls all manual transitions. |

## Key Patterns

- **Session lifecycle**: `tasks.id` is the Minions task ID and the Hermes root session ID. Chat and history reads all use `task.id`; Minions does not persist Hermes-returned child or continuation session IDs.
- **Chat projection**: `GET /tasks/:id/messages` loads raw rows from Hermes `SessionDB.get_messages()` via the Python worker, which filters out tool-call-only turns and empty messages. The client shows optimistic messages during streaming and loads the projected history from Hermes on page load/task switch.
- **Completion judge**: After each successful chat stream, `consumeChatRun()` fires a `judge.completion` request to the Python worker with the task title, description, and the agent's accumulated response text (truncated to ~4KB). The judge creates a throwaway AIAgent with `reasoning_effort=none`, evaluates the response, and returns `{done, reason}`. If `done=true` and the task is still `in_progress`, the server auto-moves it to `in_review` and broadcasts the update. Judge failures are non-critical — the task stays as-is.
- **Agent defaults**: Global default model/reasoning settings are stored in the Python worker via `settings.set` and surfaced through `GET /api/agent/defaults`. The Settings page lets users pick the default model (two-panel picker with search) and reasoning effort for all new tasks. Agent settings routes live in `server/routes/agent.ts`.
- **Per-task model/reasoning**: Each task can override the default Hermes model and reasoning effort (`agent_model`, `reasoning_effort` columns on `tasks`). Settings logic lives in `server/agent-settings.ts`. The Python worker resolves the final model/provider from Hermes config + per-task overrides.
- **Live chat**: `POST /api/tasks/:id/messages` returns `202` immediately with a `runId`. The server consumes the agent stream in the background via `consumeChatRun()` in `server/routes/chat.ts`. Clients subscribe to `GET /api/tasks/:id/live` SSE for real-time `text_delta`, `thinking_delta`, `tool_progress`, `done`, and `error` events. On connect, the client receives a snapshot of the current in-memory `LiveChatRun` if one exists. Runs are kept in memory briefly after completion (30s normal, 5min on error) so late-connecting clients can catch up.
- **Live-chat state** (`server/live-chat.ts`): In-memory `Map<taskId, LiveChatRun>` accumulates streaming events into structured messages (user + assistant with tools/thinking/usage). This is ephemeral — on server restart, active run state is lost, but the Hermes session history remains in SessionDB.
- **SSE board events**: `/api/events` broadcasts board-level events (task CRUD) to all clients. Separate from per-task live chat SSE.
- **Disconnect resilience**: If the browser disconnects during a stream, the server continues draining the worker stream to completion. On successful completion, `last_agent_response_at` is recorded for the task.
- **Routines**: Hermes manages the underlying cron job state internally. Minions exposes `/api/routines` endpoints to list, create, edit, pause, resume, trigger, remove, and read local output files. Routines are standalone; Minions no longer links them to task IDs.
- **File browser**: `server/routes/files.ts` exposes CRUD operations on the `MINIONS_HOME/workspace/` directory (list, read, write, create, rename, delete, upload via multer). The client's `FileBrowserPage` provides a full file manager UI.
- **Skills catalog**: `server/skills/catalog.ts` discovers bundled skill definitions. Exposed via `server/routes/skills.ts` and rendered in the client's `SkillsPage`.
- **Server imports**: Use `.js` extensions in import paths (ESM with tsx).

## Task State Machine

```
               user creates
                    │
                    ▼
            ┌──────────────┐
  ┌─────────│  IN_PROGRESS  │◄─────────┐
  │         └───────┬───────┘          │
  │                 │                  │
  │     completion  │                  │ human moves
  │         judge   │                  │ (drag-drop)
  │      "done"     │                  │
  │                 │                  │
  │          ┌──────▼──────┐           │
  │          │  IN_REVIEW   │          │
  │          │  human       │          │
  │          │  verifies    │──────────┘
  │          └──────┬───────┘
  │                 │
  │                 │ human moves
  │                 │
  │          ┌──────▼──────┐
  └─────────►│    DONE      │
    human    │  verified    │
    moves    └─────────────┘
```

**Judge moves to**: `in_review` (via completion judge after each agent turn)
**Human moves to**: `in_progress`, `done` (via drag-and-drop or action buttons)

## Data Flows

### New Task → Agent Session

```
User creates task via UI
  → POST /api/tasks (creates task in SQLite; tasks.id is the Hermes root session ID)
  → Task appears on board in "In Progress" column
  → User sends first message via POST /api/tasks/:id/messages
  → Server returns 202 with runId; client subscribes to GET /tasks/:id/live SSE
  → Server calls consumeChatRun() with session ID equal to task.id
  → LiveChatRun accumulates text_delta/thinking/tools into in-memory messages
  → Each event is broadcast to /live SSE subscribers in real time
  → Python worker loads prior Hermes history, runs AIAgent.run_conversation()
  → Hermes persists the full turn (user + assistant) in SessionDB
  → Successful completion records tasks.last_agent_response_at
  → Run state expires from memory after TTL; history loads from Hermes on next page load
```

### Completion Judge

```
Chat stream completes (done event in consumeChatRun)
  → Accumulated response text available from stream
  → Fire judgeTaskCompletion() (async, non-blocking)
  → Send judge.completion request to Python worker with task title, description, response text
  → Worker creates throwaway AIAgent with reasoning_effort=none
  → Judge prompt asks: "given the task and response, is the task complete?"
  → Returns {done: boolean, reason: string}
  → IF done=true AND task.status === 'in_progress':
      → Update task status to 'in_review'
      → Broadcast task_updated event
  → IF done=false or judge fails: task stays as-is
```

## Worker Protocol

The Python worker communicates via JSONL (one JSON object per line) over stdin/stdout.

**Request types**: `health`, `chat`, `judge.completion`, `session.messages.get`, `session.get`, `settings.get`, `settings.set`, `models.list`, `routines.jobs.list`, `routines.jobs.get`, `routines.jobs.create`, `routines.jobs.update`, `routines.jobs.runs`, `routines.jobs.run.content`, `routines.jobs.pause`, `routines.jobs.resume`, `routines.jobs.run`, `routines.jobs.remove`, `routines.tick`

**Stream events** (emitted during `chat` requests):

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `text_delta` | Agent's visible response text |
| `thinking_delta` | Agent's reasoning content |
| `tool_progress` | Tool lifecycle (`running` / `completed` / `error`) with name and duration |
| `done` | Stream complete — carries `sessionId` and `usage` |
| `error` | Error with message, optional `code` and `hint` |

**Thinking content**: Live reasoning streams as `thinking_delta`. Historical reasoning is projected from Hermes `reasoning_content` / `reasoning` into `msg.thinking` when available.

## Client Routes

| Path | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | `Board` | Kanban board (3 columns + drag-and-drop) |
| `/tasks/new` | `NewTaskPage` | Create task + initial chat with agent |
| `/tasks/:taskId` | `TaskDetailPage` | Task detail + chat thread |
| `/routines` | `RoutinesPage` | Create and manage recurring Hermes routines |
| `/cron` | redirect | Browser bookmark redirect to `/routines` |
| `/skills` | `SkillsPage` | Browse bundled skill definitions |
| `/files` | `FileBrowserPage` | File manager for workspace directory |
| `/settings` | `SettingsPage` | Theme, default model + reasoning effort |

## Environment Variables

All optional — defaults work for local development.

```

## Hermes Python Library

The Python worker imports Hermes `AIAgent` from the local agent directory (not via pip). Key API surface used:

- **`AIAgent(model, provider, session_id, session_db, ...)`**: Constructor takes model/provider config, session tracking, callbacks for streaming deltas, and tool configuration. Create one instance per conversation turn — not thread-safe across concurrent calls.
- **`agent.run_conversation(user_message, system_message, conversation_history, task_id)`**: Full control method returning `{"final_response", "messages", "input_tokens", "output_tokens", ...}`. The worker passes sanitized history from `SessionDB.get_messages_as_conversation()` as `conversation_history`.
- **`SessionDB`**: From `hermes_state` module. Used for `get_messages()` (raw rows for chat projection), `get_messages_as_conversation()` (formatted history for agent replay), `get_session()` (session metadata with token counts/cost), and `resolve_resume_session_id()` (follow session chains).
- **Callbacks**: `stream_delta_callback` (text), `reasoning_callback` (thinking), `tool_progress_callback` (tool lifecycle events). These are passed to the constructor and fire during `run_conversation()`.

## Future

- **Additional adapters**: The `AgentAdapter` interface (`server/adapters/types.ts`) is pluggable. Other OpenAI-compatible backends (OpenClaw, LiteLLM, etc.) could implement it.
